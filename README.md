**Max-min threshold-based cancelable biometric templates for low-end devices**<br>Gourav Siddhad and Pritee Khanna<br>

**Abstract:** Biometrics are widely used in security systems, but it has drawbacks such as its nonreusability, being susceptible to getting stolen, and being prone to unauthorized access. These issues can be tackled using cancelable biometrics. In this work, features extracted using Log-Gabor filters are processed according to the proposed max-min thresholding. The resulting binary features are transformed by random projection on a key matrix to create a cancelable template. The method was carefully evaluated using publicly accessible datasets of face near-infrared, palm print, palm vein, dorsal vein, wrist vein, and knuckle print. A significant improvement in performance over many recent methods was observed. Also, the effectiveness of the generated cancelable templates was observed in the general, stolen token, and changeable scenarios. The generated template is 25% of the original input size, which makes it efficient for low-end devices.<br>
